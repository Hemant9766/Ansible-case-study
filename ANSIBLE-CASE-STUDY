Sure, I'll provide you with a detailed solution using Ansible roles to achieve the tasks outlined for configuring Apache and Nginx server groups and installing Java on the Apache server group.
1. Directory Structure:
   First, let's set up the directory structure for Ansible roles and playbook:
   ```
   ansible/
   ├── roles
   │   ├── apache
   │   │   └── tasks
   │   │       └── main.yml
   │   ├── nginx
   │   │   └── tasks
   │   │       └── main.yml
   │   ├── java
   │   │   └── tasks
   │   │       └── main.yml
   ├── playbook.yml
   └── inventory.ini
   ```
2. inventory.ini:

   Create an inventory file (`inventory.ini`) with the IP addresses of the servers in respective groups:

   ```ini
   [apache_servers]
   apache_server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10
   [nginx_servers]
   nginx_server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.11
   ```

3. Roles for Apache and Nginx:

   In `roles/apache/tasks/main.yml`, define tasks for Apache setup:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Install Apache
     apt:
       name: apache2
       state: present

   - name: Push Apache HTML file
     copy:
       content: "<html><body>Apache Server</body></html>"
       dest: /var/www/html/index.html

   - name: Start Apache service
     systemd:
       name: apache2
       state: started

   - name: Post-installation message for Apache
     debug:
       msg: "Apache installation and setup completed."
   ```
   In `roles/nginx/tasks/main.yml`, define tasks for Nginx setup:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Install Nginx
     apt:
       name: nginx
       state: present

   - name: Push Nginx HTML file
     copy:
       content: "<html><body>Nginx Server</body></html>"
       dest: /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

   - name: Start Nginx service
     systemd:
       name: nginx
       state: started

   - name: Post-installation message for Nginx
     debug:
       msg: "Nginx installation and setup completed."
   ```

4. Role for Java:

   In `roles/java/tasks/main.yml`, define tasks to install Java on Apache server group:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Install Java
     apt:
       name: default-jdk
       state: present

   - name: Post-installation message for Java
     debug:
       msg: "Java installation completed."
   ```

5. Playbook (playbook.yml):

   Use the defined roles in a playbook to achieve the specified tasks:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Configure Apache and Nginx server groups
     hosts: apache_servers
     become: yes
     roles:
       - apache

   - name: Configure Nginx server group
     hosts: nginx_servers
     become: yes
     roles:
       - nginx

   - name: Install Java on Apache server group
     hosts: apache_servers
     become: yes
     roles:
       - java
   ```

6. Executing the Playbook:

   Run the playbook using the `ansible-playbook` command:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
   ```

This playbook will configure Apache and Nginx server groups, push HTML files, start the services, and install Java on the Apache server group as per the defined roles and tasks. Adjust the IP addresses and specific configurations based on your environment.
